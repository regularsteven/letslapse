# LetsLapse — open jobs

The queue of work that has been scoped but not done. One entry per job: what it
is, why it matters, and where the detail lives. A job leaves this list when it
ships, not when it is started.

Long jobs get their own document and are referenced from here. Short ones can
live inline.

## Open

### Storage accounting, and the Settings storage card

**Detail:** [storage-accounting-job.md](storage-accounting-job.md) ·
**Raised:** 2026-08-21 · **Not started**

Deleting every project on the bench iPhone freed 0.08 GB of a claimed 26.29 GB.
Capture staging is cloned into the project on adoption and never released, share
archives are never deleted, and the tmp filter matches neither — so the device is
sitting on **44.6 GB the app reports as `Cache Zero KB`**. Four defects, plus a
redesign of the storage card around reclaimable bytes rather than allocated ones.
Includes a one-time reclaim for installs already carrying orphans, and a
design-sync pass on the Settings SVGs.

### `swift test` fails on a dead scratch path

**Raised:** 2026-08-22 · **Not started** · small

`LinearDNGTests.testBlendsRealUntouchedSequence` writes its output to a
hard-coded absolute path from a long-finished Claude Code session
(`Kit/Tests/LetsLapseKitTests/LinearDNGTests.swift:156`), so `swift test` ends
`243 tests, 1 failure` with `writeFailed("The folder "untouched-blend-3.dng"
doesn't exist.")`. It only bites where there is real capture data — without an
untouched-DNG project in `~/Library/Application Support/LetsLapse/Projects` the
test `XCTSkip`s — which means it fails on the dev machine and passes anywhere
else. Point it at `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` (or a
`URL.temporaryDirectory` subfolder created by the test). Until it is fixed,
`.claude/skills/run-letslapse/SKILL.md` documents the failure as expected.

### `remote_probe` script grammar can't express a scheduled stop

**Raised:** 2026-08-22 · **Not started** · small

A step is parsed as either `cmd:extra` **or** `cmd#value`, never both (`#` is
tested first, `tools/remote_probe.swift` ~line 249). `scheduleStop` needs a
`stopAtUnit` token *and* an amount, so it is the one command in the vocabulary
the probe cannot send — `/letslapse` times its shoots from the Mac instead,
which is less robust than a device-owned deadline over a flaky link. Allow
`cmd:extra#value`. While in there: the file's header comment lists **two**
`Shared/` sources and it needs **three** (`WatchMessageKey.swift` is missing),
and `CLAUDE.md` says four. Also worth adding the video keys (`baseFPS`,
`rampFPS`, `sequenceMode`, `segmentCount`, `markerCount`) to `digest()` — a
video run's one-line digest currently shows almost nothing.

## Where the rest of the open work is recorded

Not everything known-broken has been turned into a job yet. Until it is, these
are the standing lists:

- **[letslapse-app-overview.md](letslapse-app-overview.md) §10 — "Current limits
  and sharp edges."** The honest known-issues list for the whole app: the ramp
  voiding the warp timeline, the reframe canvas framing an approximate frame,
  `ReframeTrack.clamp` never being called, the responsive-capture wedge, the
  test gaps. Several of these are jobs waiting to be written up.
- **[overview-audit-2026-08-10.md](overview-audit-2026-08-10.md) Part C.** The
  reframe UX triage table — problems, severity, and the use cases the feature
  should serve.
- **[design/](design/) — each platform folder's `INDEX.md`.** Per-screen mirror
  status; anything marked stale is outstanding UI work by definition.
- **Holy Grail Field Program** (artifact). The blend-strategy field programme:
  what has been run, what passed, what the next bench is for.
