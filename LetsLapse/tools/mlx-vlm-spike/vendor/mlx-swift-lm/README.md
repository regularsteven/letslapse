# MLX Swift LM

MLX Swift LM is a Swift package to build tools and applications with large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `main` branch is a _new_ major version number: 3.x.  In order
> to decouple from tokenizer and downloader packages some breaking
> changes were introduced. See [upgrading documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/main/documentation/mlxlmcommon/upgrade) for detailed instructions on upgrading.

> and [using](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/blob/main/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Documentation.docc/using.md)

Some key features include:

- Model loading with integrations for a variety of tokenizer and model downloading packages.
- Low-rank (LoRA) and full model fine-tuning with support for quantized models.
- Many model architectures for both LLMs and VLMs.

For some example applications and tools that use MLX Swift LM, check out [MLX Swift Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples).

## Usage

This package integrates with a variety of tokenizer and downloader packages through protocol conformance. Users can pick from three ways to integrate with these packages, which offer different tradeoffs between freedom and convenience.

See documentation on [how to integrate mlx-swift-lm and downloaders/tokenizers](https://swiftpackageindex.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/main/documentation/mlxlmcommon/using).

## Installation

Add the core package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.31.3")),
```

Then chose an [integration package for downloaders and tokenizers](https://swiftpackageindex.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/main/documentation/mlxlmcommon/using#Integration-Packages).

## Quick Start

See also [MLXLMCommon](Libraries/MLXLMCommon). The simplest way to get started is using the `MLXHuggingFace` macros, which provide a default Hugging Face downloader and tokenizer integration.

## Package.swift

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.31.3")),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/huggingface/swift-huggingface", from: "0.9.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/huggingface/swift-transformers", from: "1.3.0"),
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTargetName",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "MLXLLM", package: "mlx-swift-lm"),
            .product(name: "MLXLMCommon", package: "mlx-swift-lm"),
            .product(name: "MLXHuggingFace", package: "mlx-swift-lm"),
            .product(name: "HuggingFace", package: "swift-huggingface"),
            .product(name: "Tokenizers", package: "swift-transformers"),
        ]),
]
```

## Usage

```swift
import MLXLLM
import MLXLMCommon
import MLXHuggingFace
import HuggingFace
import Tokenizers

let model = try await #huggingFaceLoadModelContainer(
    configuration: LLMRegistry.gemma3_1B_qat_4bit
)

let session = ChatSession(model)
print(try await session.respond(to: "What are two things to see in San Francisco?"))
print(try await session.respond(to: "How about a great place to eat?"))
```

For alternative integration approaches (custom downloaders, alternative tokenizer packages, local-only weights), see the [using documentation](Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Documentation.docc/using.md).
