/// Protocol for Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) speculative drafter models.
///
/// Mirrors `EmbeddingModel`'s relationship to `BaseLanguageModel`: this
/// protocol refines `BaseLanguageModel` with drafter-specific surface, so
/// implementations inherit weight loading and `sanitize` hooks while defining
/// their own forward signature.
///
/// MTP drafters do **not** conform to `LanguageModel` — their I/O contract is
/// different: a drafter consumes the target's last hidden state and per
/// layer-type shared K/V, produces a block of K-1 candidate tokens in a
/// single call, and holds no transient round-state between calls. The
/// `MTPSpeculativeTokenIterator` extracts the shared K/V from the target's
/// `LMOutput.state` and threads it to the drafter as a method argument.
///
/// Conforming types are expected to be stateless with respect to the target
/// model: every per-round input — including the target itself — flows through
/// `draftBlock(...)` as a method parameter. This makes drafter instances safe
/// to share across iterators without per-iterator mutable state.
public protocol MTPDrafterModel: BaseLanguageModel {
    /// K-step drafting from a constant position.

    /// Returns the proposed tokens as a `[B, blockSize - 1]` MLXArray. The
    /// drafter holds no transient round-state between calls — every per-round
    /// input is threaded as a method argument.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - target: The main language model this drafter is speculating for.
    ///     Used to look up target-derived constants (input embeddings, embed
    ///     scale, etc.) inline per round; conformers must not retain or
    ///     mutate references derived from `target`.
    ///   - lastToken: Bonus token from the target's last verify pass, shape `[B]`.
    ///   - lastHidden: Target's last hidden state, shape `[B, 1, backbone_hidden_size]`.
    ///   - sharedKV: Dict keyed by `layer_type` (`"full_attention"` /
    ///     `"sliding_attention"`) mapping to `(keys, values)` `MLXArray`s for
    ///     the last layer of that layer-type in the target.
    ///   - queryOffset: Constant absolute position for the round (the
    ///     position the bonus token sits at in the target's KV cache).
    ///     Passed as a Swift `Int` rather than an `MLXArray` to avoid the
    ///     `.item()` round-trip that would otherwise stall the GPU per
    ///     speculation round.

    ///     `blockSize - 1`; the bonus token is implicit).
    ///   - sampler: `LogitSampler` to apply to each step's logits.
    /// - Returns: `[B, blockSize - 1]` token array.
